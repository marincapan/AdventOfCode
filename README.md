## 2021

So much hype was about this AoC year. Sadly, because of the administrative work I have to do for the Club I am not sleeping regularly nor normally so I didn't want to make it worse by doing AoC in the morning. The guys were strong competition and I am glad Barba won, he really did the work! As for me, I will try to solve a few during the holidays :)

## 2020

The 2020 race has officially started and I am late on my first day, mainly because I went to sleep half an hour before the first task opened. Gracefully I woke up to bitter-sweet news. The global leaderboard wasn't counting score from the first day since there were technical difficulties. Let's see how long I will last this year :')

## 2019

In 2019 I started my AoC journey thanks to KSET nad the Computing section which has a long tradition of friendly competing in solving AoC tasks. As you can see, for me it lasted only 3 days. i am hoping next year will be more time :)
